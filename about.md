This website is a resource-in-progress for people in the United States interested in accessing their own mental health records. Inspired by projects like [Find and Connect](https://www.findandconnect.gov.au/) in Australia, Mental Health Records Project aims to make the world of bureaucratic and "official" records of healthcare, social services, and incarceration more accessible to the people whose lives the records document and directly impact.

The site is currently maintained by [Noah Geraci](https://noahgeraci.com), a librarian and self-advocate based in California.
